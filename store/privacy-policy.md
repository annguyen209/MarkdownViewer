# Privacy Policy

MarkdownViewer (the "App") does not collect or transmit personal data to external services.

What the app does:
- The App reads files from the local filesystem only when you open them through the File dialog or drag-and-drop.
- File contents are rendered locally within the application to provide the preview feature.

Data storage:
- The app stores non-sensitive metadata locally (e.g., recent files list) in the user's local application storage for convenience.

Third-party services:
- The App uses open-source libraries (e.g., markdown-it, highlight.js) which are distributed with the application; these libraries do not send data externally.

Contact:
- Provide a contact email or website for privacy inquiries.
